                <p> Christopher Nolan did a fantastic job with this movie! <em>Inception</em> is a MIND BENDING sci-fi that will keep you intrigued. It is a long movie that runs about two and a half hours. I would usually need breaks in between before I lose focus with watching a movie that long, but with <em>Inception</em>, the complexity of the storyline kept me wanting to watch till the end. I have seen this movie more than once and each time I watch it, I understand more of the plot. The soundtrack really keeps the mood suspenseful, and it was an excellent choice to work with Hans Zimmer.<br><br>
                The ending will keep you on the edge of your seat where you will be like “WHAT THE EFF!”.  Leonardo DiCaprio was a great choice for the character Cobb. He works his way invading dream after dream trying to steal secrets and gets stuck between what he ultimately wants. <em>Inception</em> was a genius idea for a movie. I 100% recommend if you love Sci-fi/mind-bending/thriller/action.

                    <h3>Trivia</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In an effort to combat confusion, television broadcasts in Japan include text in the upper-left corner of the screen to remind viewers in which level of the dream a specific scene takes place.</li>

                        <li>In spite of this movie's extensive surreal effects sequences, the majority of visual effects throughout the movie, such as the Penrose stairs, rotating hallway, mountain avalanche, and zero-gravity sequences, were created through practical methods, not through the use of computer graphics imagery. This movie only has around five hundred visual effects shots, as opposed to most other visual effects epics, which can have upwards of two thousand visual effects shots.</li>

                        <li>If you take the first letters of the main characters' names, Dom, Robert, Eames, Arthur, Mal and Saito, they spell "Dreams". If you add Peter, Ariadne, and Yusuf, the whole makes "Dreams Pay", which is what they do for a mind thief.</li>
